<h2>What is a &quot;good&quot; under the UCC?</h2>
<p>Article 2-105(1) says: &quot;Goods&quot; means all things (including specially manufactured goods) which are <strong>moveable</strong> at the time of <strong>identification</strong> to the contract for sale other than money in which the price is to be paid, investment securities and things in action. Thus, under Article 2, there are two tests for &quot;goods:&quot; a substance test - <strong>moveability</strong>; and a timing test - <strong>identification</strong>. Computer programs <strong>do not fit under either one</strong>.</p>
<h3>Moveablility</h3>
<p>Is a computer program moveable? Several courts and commentators have thought so. But remember, <strong>we are not talking about the copy</strong> of the computer program; we are talking about the computer program itself. That is what these authorities say is a &quot;good.&quot;</p>
<p>So try this experiment. Log on to the Linux Web site and download a copy of LIuqx onto your hard disc. If the learned authorities are right - if a computer program becomes a tangible, moveable good when it is embodied in a copy - then LiNUX the computer program has migrated to your hard disc and is no longer available on the Linux Web site.</p>
<p>It should have moved. But wait. Go back to the Linux Web site and check it out. LiNux is still there, waiting to be copied. It has not moved. In fact, it is now in two places at the same time. How can this be?</p>
<p>A computer program is supposed to be moveable. This means travelling from one place to another. How can a moveable computer program be in two places at the some time?</p>
<p>Try another test. Run to Anchorage and start distributing copies of LINuX without complying with the GNU Public License; infringe the copyright.3 6 Now run to Miami and do the same thing. If LINUX the computer program is indeed moveable in the marketplace then it stands to reason that it cannot be in two different marketplaces at the same time. You cannot sue for the same injury to the same car in two different places. Moving from point A to point B necessarily means leaving point A. If you believe this about LINUX, be prepared for a rude awakening. Like things in action, which by definition are not goods, a copyright in a computer program is an intangible interest, which may be enforced simultaneously everywhere. These hypothetical experiments are tongue-in-cheek, but the point is not. A copy of a computer program may be tangible and moveable, but not the computer program - the copyrightable work. <strong>The computer program is intangible, immovable, and simultaneously everywhere</strong>. Those that argue otherwise make the junior's mistake of confusing the copy with the copyright.</p>
<h3>Identification</h3>
<p>Now let's look at the identification test.</p>
<p>Is the software identified <strong>to</strong> the contract or <strong>by</strong> the contract?</p>
<p>Again, consider LINux. If the computer program LINUX is a good, then what exactly is it that is identified to the contract when you acquire a CD at CompUSA? If LINUx is a good, then under Article 2-401, title to LINUX the computer program must necessarily pass by operation of law. But &quot;title&quot; to LINUX would mean the entire, worldwide, perpetual copyright, while the GNU Public License only grants a limited, non-exclusive license. LINUX the computer program is not identified to the contract; rather the object of the contract - the scope of the grant - is identified by the license. Goods, being tangible, can be identified by the senses apart from the contract and must be identified to it. Copyright interests, being intangible, are only delimited by words in the contract. &quot;But,&quot; you say &quot;I left CompUSA with a CD. This is a tangible copy. Surely this is the good identified to the contract.&quot; Maybe, but beside the point. The issue is not whether the blank CD is identified, but whether the computer program embodied on the CD is also identified . 8 7 Article 2-501(1) is explicit that identification must occur no later than: (i) for existing goods, when the contract is made; or (ii) for future goods, when they are designated as the&nbsp;goods to which the contract refers.3 Now, when you took the CD home, you probably copied the computer program onto your hard drive. That hard drive copy did not exist when you stood at the cash register. What existed, what was necessarily the only object that could be identified to the contract under Article 2-501, was the copy of the computer program in the CD case. You can argue that the copy on your hard drive was a future good, but did the store clerk really designate that payment was not for the CD in your hand but for the hard disk copy you might make later on? I think not. That means that under Article 2-501, the copy that was made on your hard drive could not have possibly been identified to the contract. So if the copy on your hard drive is the computer program that does not &quot;work,&quot; that means - but you get the point. And what happens when a copy is downloaded over the Internet? Kaplan v. Cablevision of Pennsylvania, Inc. held that the delivery of cable television programming signals was not a &quot;transaction in goods&quot; under the UCC because programming signals are not &quot;fairly identifiable as movables before the contract is performed.&quot;39&deg; Digital signals passed by electronic means over the Internet to download copies of computer programs should also not qualify as identified goods. Article 2 is about the sale of wares - tangible, moveable hard goods identifiable by the senses. Computer programs are intangible products of the mind that are immovable and simultaneously everywhere. They are not delimited by the senses but described in words. They are not identified to a contract but by a contract. Yet the Article 2 eschatology would have it that these intangibles nonetheless descend into physical form where they lose forever their incorporeal essence to become only dense matter. Tales of angels that take on human form and forfeit their immortality make engaging movies and wonderful stories. But such imaginings belong to myth, not law.</p>
<h2>A Software License is Not a &quot;Sale&quot;</h2>
<p>Article 2-105(1) says that Article 2 applies to &quot;transactions&quot; in goods, not just &quot;sales.&quot; Does this mean that Article 2 can apply to software licenses because they are transactions? An interesting distinction, but pointless. Article 2 deals with, and the definition of</p>
<p>goods is cast in terms of, a contract of sale.3 91 Article 2-106(1) says: In this Article unless the context otherwise requires, &quot;contract&quot; and &quot;agreement&quot; are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. &quot;Contract for sale&quot; includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A &quot;sale&quot; consists of the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (Section 2401). A &quot;present sale&quot; means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.3 92 The inclusion of transactions within Article 2-105(1) is meant to cover a limited number of familiar situations which are not technically sales but are nonetheless are covered in the statute, most particularly consignments.3 93 It does not sweep every commercial transaction involving goods into Article 2. Novemedix, Ltd. v. NDM Acquisition Corp.394 made that point. The case involved a settlement agreement to a patent infringement suit, which called for the delivery of the allegedly infringing inventory to the patent owner. When the inventory proved to be defective as well as infringing, the irate patent owner brought suit for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability under Article 2. To the patent owner, this was surely a &quot;transaction in goods&quot; within the scope of Article 2. The Federal Circuit saw it otherwise: Many commercial transactions are not governed by Article 2 of the UCC: sale of land or securities, assignment of a contract right, or granting a license under a patent or copyright, to name just a few. The mere fact that title to Article 2 goods changes hands during one of these transactions does not by that fact alone make the transaction a sale of goods .... Here, the mere fact that the parties' settlement agreement includes the transfer of personal property in its provisions does not make it a simple sale of goods (slippers) for a price (release of a legal claim) .... The settlement agreement is no more a contract for the sale of slippers than it is a licensing agreement for NDM's patents. In fact, it is neither exclusively; it is a mixed contract .... 395</p>
<p>Novemedix indicates the real reason for trying to apply Article 2 to software transactions: to impose an implied warranty of merchantability or fitness. But these implied warranties only apply to a &quot;contract&quot; of a sale,396 not any &quot;transaction&quot; in goods. A sale means &quot;the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price.&quot; 97 In a non-exclusive software license, there is as a matter of federal law no transfer of copyright ownership398 to begin with, hence no sale of the computer program ever occurs. There may be a sale of the CD embodying the computer program, but not the licensed computer program. In an exclusive license, there is a transfer of copyright ownership, but this is not a passing of title in the Article 2 sense due to the numerous ownership interests retained by the licensor.39 Think again of LINUX. This license is non-exclusive. A customer who acquires a copy of LINux does not acquire any ownership interest in the computer program, so the legally separate license from the Linux organization cannot be a sale of goods even under Article 2's own definitions.&quot; It seems so counter-intuitive. The customer is after all walking off with a physical object - the CD and the packaging. It also seems counter-intuitive that the Sun does not orbit the Earth. But looking beyond facade to fact yields the conclusion that neither intuition is correct.40 1 A software transaction is a license of a computer program, not a sale of goods. Some commentators say that software vendors call a software transaction a license to avoid the first sale doctrine,4 but this is incorrect. These commentators think that a software transaction can only be a sale or a license, one or the other, take it or leave it. They fail to understand that software transactions have two independent components, one of which might involve the sale of a copy, but the other part, the real substance, involves a license of</p>
<p>computer information. Software vendors call their transactions licenses to avoid inappropriate application of Article 2 in ways that ignore the license, or worse, subject the license to the default rules in Article 2. Many programs, like LIwux, give a licensee greater rights than are allowed by the first sale doctrine, and the licensee needs the license to enable that expanded use. Licensors correctly identify software transactions as licenses because that is exactly what they are.</p>
