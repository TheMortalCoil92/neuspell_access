<h2>What is a &quot;good&quot; under the UCC?</h2>
<p>Article 2-105(1) says: &quot;Goods&quot; means all things (including specially manufactured goods) which are <strong>moveable</strong> at the time of <strong>identification</strong> to the contract for sale other than money in which the price is to be paid, investment securities and things in action. Thus, under Article 2, there are two tests for &quot;goods:&quot; a substance test - <strong>moveability</strong>; and a timing test - <strong>identification</strong>. Computer programs <strong>do not fit under either one</strong>.</p>
<h3>Moveablility</h3>
<p>Is a computer program moveable? Several courts and commentators have thought so. But remember, <strong>we are not talking about the copy</strong> of the computer program; we are talking about the computer program itself. That is what these authorities say is a &quot;good.&quot;</p>
<p>So try this experiment. Log on to the Linux Web site and download a copy of LIuqx onto your hard disc. If the learned authorities are right - if a computer program becomes a tangible, moveable good when it is embodied in a copy - then LiNUX the computer program has migrated to your hard disc and is no longer available on the Linux Web site.</p>
<p>It should have moved. But wait. Go back to the Linux Web site and check it out. LiNux is still there, waiting to be copied. It has not moved. In fact, it is now in two places at the same time. How can this be?</p>
<p>A computer program is supposed to be moveable. This means travelling from one place to another. How can a moveable computer program be in two places at the some time?</p>
<p>Try another test. Run to Anchorage and start distributing copies of LINuX without complying with the GNU Public License; infringe the copyright.3 6 Now run to Miami and do the same thing. If LINUX the computer program is indeed moveable in the marketplace then it stands to reason that it cannot be in two different marketplaces at the same time. You cannot sue for the same injury to the same car in two different places. Moving from point A to point B necessarily means leaving point A. If you believe this about LINUX, be prepared for a rude awakening. Like things in action, which by definition are not goods, a copyright in a computer program is an intangible interest, which may be enforced simultaneously everywhere. These hypothetical experiments are tongue-in-cheek, but the point is not. A copy of a computer program may be tangible and moveable, but not the computer program - the copyrightable work. <strong>The computer program is intangible, immovable, and simultaneously everywhere</strong>. Those that argue otherwise make the junior's mistake of confusing the copy with the copyright.</p>
<h3>Identification</h3>
<p>Now let's look at the identification test.</p>
<p>Is the software identified <strong>to</strong> the contract or <strong>by</strong> the contract?</p>
